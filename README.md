# üõ°Ô∏è Drosera Uniswap Flash Loan Trap üé£

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a Drosera-powered security trap designed to proactively detect and respond to both Uniswap V2 and V3 flash loan attacks in real-time. I built this to demonstrate a practical, real-world example of how decentralized security monitors can be used to defend DeFi protocols.

## ü§î What is a Flash Loan Attack?

A flash loan allows a user to borrow a massive amount of cryptocurrency with no upfront collateral, but it must be repaid within the same blockchain transaction. While a powerful DeFi tool, this feature can be weaponized.

In a **flash loan attack**, a malicious actor borrows funds, uses them to manipulate a protocol's internal logic (e.g., by creating an imbalance in a price oracle), and then repays the loan, all in one atomic transaction. These attacks are incredibly fast and can be financially devastating to the target protocol. This project is a defense mechanism against such threats.

## ‚ú® What Does This Trap Do?

This Drosera trap provides real-time, on-chain threat monitoring. It is designed to:

1.  **Watch the Mempool:** Continuously inspect in-flight transactions before they are included in a block.
2.  **Identify Flash Loan Signatures:** Specifically look for the function calls that initiate flash loans on Uniswap V2 (`swap`) and V3 (`flash`).
3.  **Trigger an Automated Response:** If a flash loan signature is detected, the trap immediately calls a separate `BaitResponse` contract to execute a pre-defined security action.

All of this happens decentrally, without relying on any off-chain infrastructure.

---

## üí° Why Is It Innovative?

This approach to security offers several key advantages:

*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** It detects threats *before* they are executed on-chain, unlike post-mortem analysis tools.
*   **Fully Decentralized:** The detection and response mechanism is run by a network of independent Drosera operators, removing single points of failure.
*   **Transparent & Verifiable:** Since the trap and response are on-chain, anyone can audit the logic and verify the actions taken.
*   **Cost-Efficient:** It avoids the need to build, host, and maintain centralized monitoring infrastructure.

## üìù The Response Mechanism

As defined in `drosera.toml`, when the trap is triggered, the Drosera network makes a direct function call to the `BaitResponse` contract.

**1. The Function Call (The Direct Response):**
The network calls the `execute` function, passing the encoded flash loan data as a `bytes` argument.

```solidity
function execute(bytes calldata data) external;
```

**2. The On-Chain Record (The Result):**
Inside the `execute` function, the contract decodes the data and emits a `FlashLoanCaught` event. This event serves as the permanent, on-chain record of the detected threat.

```solidity
event FlashLoanCaught(
    address indexed recipient,
    uint256 amount0,
    uint256 amount1
);
```

This two-step process provides a robust and verifiable response to detected threats.

## Trap Details
- `path` = `"out/FlashBait.sol/FlashBait.json"`
- `response_contract` = `"0x63911db5c8d6efee51fbf397eca1ddbbd3dcd877"`
- `response_function` = `"executeBytes(bytes)"`
- `address` = `"0x215B8dDDAF7b18d3055478740c89C2E4E60351F1"` **(trap address)**

## üöÄ Setup & Deploy

To get this project running, follow these steps. You will need [Foundry & Bun](https://github.com/0xmoei/Drosera-Network/#1-configure-enviorments) installed, just as you did for the `helloworld` test trap by Drosera. As well as other packages like `docker`, `screen`, etc.

**1. Clone and Install Dependencies:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deeanalyst/uniswap-flashloan-trap.git
cd uniswap-flashloan-trap
bun install
forge build
```

**2. Deploy the Trap:**

```
DROSERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...0000 drosera apply
```

## ‚úÖ Testing

The project includes a full test suite. To run the tests and verify the logic, use the following Foundry command:

> Create a `.env` file in the trap directory and add your RPC URL and private key. This file is ignored by Git.

> The content of your `.env` should be this üëá
```bash
HOODI_RPC_URL="your_hoodi_testnet_rpc_url"
PRIVATE_KEY="your_wallet_private_key"
```

```bash
forge test
```

## üí° Future Improvements

This project provides a solid foundation, but there are many ways it could be extended:

*   **Deeper Inspection:** Instead of just matching function selectors, the trap could be enhanced to parse the transaction data more deeply, such as verifying that the call is being made to a legitimate Uniswap pool address.
*   **Broader DEX Support:** The logic could be expanded to detect flash loans from other major DEXs like Sushiswap, Aave, or Balancer.
*   **More Sophisticated Responses:** The `BaitResponse` contract could be built out with more advanced logic, such as a circuit-breaker that pauses critical protocol functions or a mechanism to notify a multi-sig wallet via an on-chain event.
*   **Gas Optimization:** Further analysis could be done to optimize the gas usage of the trap's detection logic, making it even more efficient for the Drosera operators to run.
